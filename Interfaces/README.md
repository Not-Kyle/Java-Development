# What are interfaces?

> Interfaces are looked at like a blueprint for a class(s), It tells you what methods a class must have but usually does not provide their implementation.
> Any class that will implement the interface, must have the assigned methods listed.

## Why use interfaces? 

> It ensures all implementing classes have the required methods.
> It gives you a cleaner and more organized code.
> Polymorphism, it lets you write code that works with any class that implements the interface.
> A class an implement multiple interfaces, giving it different abilities without messy inheritance.

## What can interfaces do?

> Create an object? No
> Have method bodies? Usually not
> Can have fields? Yes but only constants. (static final)
